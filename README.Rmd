|![soundscaper hexsticker](man/figures/soundscaper_hexsticker.png) |The goal of `soundscaper` is to provide a standardized analytical pipeline for the computation, visualization and diversity estimation of soundscapes. The package is designed to work with either continuous or regular-interval long-duration acoustic recordings, and can handle both audible and ultrasonic recordings.|
