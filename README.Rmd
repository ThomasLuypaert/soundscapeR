|![soundscaper hexsticker](man/figures/soundscaper_hexsticker.png) |The goal of `soundscapeR` is to provide a standardized analytical pipeline for the computation, exploration, visualization and diversity quantification of soundscapes. The package is designed to work with either continuous or regular-interval long-duration acoustic recordings, and can handle both audible and ultrasonic recordings. More information about the workflow can be found in Luypaert et al. (2022)|

# 0. Priors

This R-package uses spectral index output files computed using the ['AnalysisPrograms'](https://ap.qut.ecoacoustics.info/) software tool, developed by the [QUT Ecoacoustics Group](https://research.ecosounds.org/). Although all the steps in the analytical pipeline can be performed using  `soundscapeR`, the package requires 'AnalysisPrograms' in the background.

As such, prior to using `soundscapeR`, please head over to the ['AnalysisPrograms' download page](https://ap.qut.ecoacoustics.info/basics/installing.html?tabs=windows), and install the latest version of the software tool on your device. 

# 1. Calculating acoustic indices

For the first step in our workflow, we are going to calculate the spectral index files for our long-duration acoustic recordings collected at our site of interest. To do this, we will make use of the `index_calc()` function. 

## 1.1. Raw acoustic data

The workflow we present here makes use of eco-acoustic data, or acoustic recordings collected at large timescales (e.g. days, weeks, months or even years!), using either a regular interval (e.g. 1 minute out of every 10 minutes recorded) or continuous sampling regime. The workflow accommodates the use recordings with high sampling rates, but beware that 

For the purposes of this vignette, a few raw sound files are provided in the package data. Let's take a look at where these files are saved on your device:

```{r}

location_soundfiles <- paste0(base::system.file("extdata", package = "soundscapeR", mustWork = TRUE), 
                              "/raw_sound_files")

print(location_soundfiles)

```

Now, let's take a look at which raw sound files are included in the package: 

```{r}
