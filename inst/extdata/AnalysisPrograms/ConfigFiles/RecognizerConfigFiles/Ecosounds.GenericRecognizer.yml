# This yml config is designed to detect acoustic objects in an artificial test file prepared by Anthony Trukinger.
# The file contains a whistle, a rectangular blob and a group of 12 smaller whistles in a 6x2 grid that can be used to detect oscillations and harmonics (perhaps)
# Resample rate must be 2 X the desired Nyquist
ResampleRate: 22050
# SegmentDuration: units=seconds;    
SegmentDuration: 60
# SegmentOverlap: units=seconds;
SegmentOverlap: 0

# Each of these profiles will be analyzed
