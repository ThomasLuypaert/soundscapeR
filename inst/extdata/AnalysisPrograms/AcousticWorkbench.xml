            <summary>
            The amount of time to wait for a request to be processed.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            We dynamically scale this value to the number of CPU cores multiplied by 10 seconds each so that in cases
            where there is back pressure the async requests do not prematurely timeout. This is important because the
            timeout calculation for HttpClient *includes* the time the request is waiting to be sent as well as the
            total request time.
