\usage{
ss_split_files(file_locs, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_locs}{The output of the `ss_find_files` function}

\item{verbose}{A boolean operator to indicate how chatty the function should be. Using verbose = TRUE leads to increased messaging on what is happening
to the files in file_locs.}
}

}
\description{
This function takes the output list of the `ss_find_files` function and checks whether the sound files in the folder
are the correct length (60 seconds). If not, the function splits the sound files into 60-second chunks and saves the files in a new
sub-directory called 'split_files'.
