\arguments{
\item{df}{The aggregated time-frequency dataframe produced by \code{\link{aggregate_df}}.}

\item{qvalue}{A positive integer or decimal number (>=0), most commonly between 0-3. This parameter modulates the sensitivity of diversity values to the relative abundance of Operational Sound Units (OSUs). A value of 0 corresponds to the richness, a value of 1 is the equivalent number of effective OSUs for the Shannon index, a value of 2 is the equivalent number of effective OSUs for the Simpson index.}

\item{type}{The scale for which the soundscape diversity is computed. Options are 'total', 'day',
'night', 'dawn', 'dusk' and 'tod' (time of day - for each unique time in the day).}

\item{date}{The first day of the recording period. Used for managing time-objects in R. \cr
Format as "YYYY-mm-dd".}

\item{lat}{The latitude of the site at which the sound files were collected, expressed in decimal degrees.}

\item{lon}{The longitude of the site at which the sound files were collected, expressed in decimal degrees.}

\item{minfreq}{A numeric value indicating the lower frequency limit for which to compute the soundscape diversity. If set to default, uses the lowest available frequency in the dataframe.}

\item{maxfreq}{A numeric value indicating the upper frequency limit for which to compute the soundscape diversity. If set to default, uses the highest available frequency in the dataframe.}

\item{mintime}{The lower time limit for which to compute the soundscape diversity, formatted as "HH:MM:SS". If set to default, uses the earliest time for which data exists in the dataframe.}

\item{maxtime}{The upper time limit for which to compute the soundscape diversity, formatted as "HH:MM:SS". If set to default, uses the latest time for which data exists in the dataframe.}

\item{twilight}{A character string of the twilight method to be used for sunrise and sunset as the boundary between day and night.
Options can be found in the \code{\link[photobiology]{day_night}} documentation.}

\item{dawnstart}{A numeric argument. If type='dawn', used to determine the start of dawn. By default, dawn starts at sunrise. Expressed as the time in seconds before sunrise.}

\item{dawnend}{A numeric argument. If type='dawn', used to determine the end of dawn. By default, dawn ends 1.5 hours after sunrise. Expressed as the time in seconds after sunrise.}

\item{duskstart}{A numeric argument. If type='dusk', used to determine the start of dusk. By default, dusk starts 1.5 hours before sunset. Expressed as the time in seconds before sunset.}

\item{duskend}{A numeric argument. If type='dusk', used to determine the end of dusk. By default, dusk ends at sunset. Expressed as the time in seconds after sunset.}

\item{freqseq}{A logical operator (TRUE/FALSE). If set to FALSE, will compute the diversity for the entire frequency range of the soundscape. If set to TRUE, will compute the diversity per frequency-bin of user-defined width (number of bins determined by nbins argument).}

\item{nbins}{A numeric argument. If freqseq is set to TRUE, determines the number of the frequency-bins by which to divide the frequency range to compute the soundscape diversity.}

\item{output}{A character string. Indicates the format in which the soundscape diversity is expressed. Options are "percentage" (the fraction between the observed soundscape diversity and the maximum possible soundscape diversity), or "raw" (the number of acoustically active OSUs in the soundscape). Defaults to "percentage".}
}
\value{
Depending on the chosen parameters, returns the soundscape diversity either a numeric value, a vector of values or a list of vectors of values.

\description{
For a set acoustic index, calculates the diversity of acoustically active Operational Sound Units (OSUs) in the soundscape. The q-parameter can be altered to modulate the diversity's sensitivity to abundance. The soundscape diversity metrics can be computed at various scales and resolutions. For instance, the user can explore the diversity for the whole soundscape, specify custom time and frequency limits, or use one of the built-in presets for diurnal-phase subsetting (day, night, dawn, dusk). Additionally, the user can track the change in soundscape diversity throughout the day. Finally, the soundscape diversity can be assessed for the entire frequency range, or per frequency-bin of user-defined width.

\strong{Note:} Soundscape diversity metrics should not be used to make inference about the diversity of the real-world biological community unless verified using ground-truthing methods.
