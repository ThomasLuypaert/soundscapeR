\arguments{
\item{aggregated_soundscape}{The aggregated soundscape object produced by
\code{\link{aggregate_df}} function.}

\item{type}{One of either "regular" or "polar". If set
to "regular", produces a regular rectangular heatmap.
If set to "polar", produces a polar heatmap suitable for
 exploring diurnal patterns.}

\item{annotate}{One of either TRUE or FALSE. If set to
TRUE, annotates the heatmap with sunrise and
sunset times,Â´and highlights the border between the
 audible and ultrasonic spectrum for human hearing.}

\item{timeinterval}{A time interval for the x-axis.
Options can be found in the
\code{\link[scales]{breaks_width}} documentation.}

\item{mintime}{The lower time limit for the x-axis,
formatted as "HH:MM:SS". Defaults to the earliest
time for which data exists in the dataframe.}

\item{maxtime}{The upper time limit for the x-axis,
formatted as "HH:MM:SS".Defaults to the latest
time for which data exists in the dataframe.}

\item{freqinterval}{The frequency interval for the y-axis,
expressed as a numeric value.}

\item{minfreq}{The lower frequency limit for the y-axis
as a numeric value. Defaults to zero.}

\item{maxfreq}{The upper frequency limit for the y-axis
as a numeric value. Defaults to the maximum frequency of
 the dataframe.}

\item{nbins}{If \code{marginplot=TRUE}, determines the
number of the frequency-bins by which to divide the
 frequency range to compute the soundscape richness
 (q=0), expressed as a single positive integer.}

\item{twilight}{A character string of the twilight
method to be used for sunrise and sunset annotation.
Options can be found in the
 \code{\link[photobiology]{day_night}} documentation.}

\item{labelsize_time}{If annotate=TRUE, can be used to
alter the size of temporal spectrum annotation. Please
 provide as a single positive integer with a value > 0.}

\item{labelsize_frequency}{If annotate=TRUE, can be used
to alter the size of frequency spectrum annotation.
Please provide as a single positive integer with a
value > 0.}

\item{labelsize_polar}{If type="polar", can be used to
alter the size of the frequency axis labels. Please
 provide as a single positive integer with a value > 0.}

\item{palette}{A character string indicating the
colormap option to use. Four options are available:
 "magma" (or "A"), "inferno" (or "B"), "plasma" (or "C"),
 "viridis" (or "D", the default option) and "cividis"
 (or "E"). Consult \url{https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/viridisLite/versions/0.3.0/topics/viridis} for options.}

\item{direction}{Sets the order of colors in the scale.
If 1, the default, the regular order is followed.
If -1, the order of colors is reversed.}

\item{zero.black}{One of either TRUE or FALSE.
If set to TRUE, absent OSUs with incidence zero
will be colored black}

\item{marginplot}{One of either TRUE or FALSE.
If set to TRUE, adds marginal plots to the x- and y-axes.
For the x-axis, the marginal plot displays the smoothed
 richness of acoustically active frequency bins for
 each time of day. For the y-axis, the marginal plot
  displays the smoothed richness of acoustically
  active time-bins for each frequency band. Note that
   marginal plots are not available for type="polar".}

\item{n_time}{If marginplot=TRUE, determines the backward
window length for smoothing the temporal richness.
Please supply the argument as a single positive integer.}

\item{n_freq}{If marginplot=TRUE, determines the backward
window length for smoothing the frequency richness.
Please supply the argument as a single positive integer.}

\item{interactive}{One of either TRUE or FALSE.
If set to TRUE, an interactive plot is produced using
 \code{\link[plotly]{ggplotly}}. Note that interactive
  plots are not available for marginplot=TRUE.}

\item{save}{One of either TRUE or FALSE. If set to TRUE,
saves the plot using \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggsave}}, and
 the 'dir', 'filename' and 'device' arguments.}

\item{dir}{Path of the directory to save plot to:
path and filename are combined to create the
fully qualified file name. Defaults to the working
 directory. For more information consult
  \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggsave}}.}

\item{filename}{The file name without the extension. For
more information consult \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggsave}}.}

\item{device}{Device to use. Can either be a device
function (e.g. png()), or one of "eps", "ps",
"tex" (pictex), "pdf", "jpeg", "tiff", "png", "bmp",
 "svg" or "wmf" (windows only). Defaults to "png".
 For more information consult
  \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggsave}}.}

\item{width}{If save=TRUE, expresses the width of the
saved image in milimeters. Defaults to 100 mm.}

\item{height}{If save=TRUE, expresses the height of the
saved image in milimeters. Defaults to 100 mm.}
}
\value{
Returns a ggplot heatmap object and if save=TRUE,
 saves the plot in a directory of choice using a
 specified device and filename.
}
\description{
Creates a soundscape heatmap to visualize
 the use of acoustic space in the time-frequency domain
  for an set acoustic index. The function is highly
  flexible, allowing the user maximal control over every
   aspect of the heatmap. Please consult the arguments
    section to find out more about visualization options.
